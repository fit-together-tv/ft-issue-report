## Changelog

Landing page: https://hello.chuongnau.com

App: https://app.chuongnau.com

### Late May - August 2

- Add user detail fields (first name, last name, etc) that participants must complete before they are able to submit.
- Allow unlimited question form duration and 0-point questions.
- Detect suspicious activities when participant are working on the questions, such as resizing, mouse hovering outside of app boundaries. These will be reported under each participant's submission in the submission overview page.
- Allow sorting by score in submission overview page.
- Allow tagging questions with additional information, such as target grade, textbook, question type etc.
- Add question groups to simplify creation of questions that have the same premise and/or are related to/follow-ups of each other. Question groups can also be tagged similarly to standalone questions.
- Add question library with standalone and grouped questions. At the moment, there are a total of 1200 questions in the system that can be reused.
- Allow exporting question form to Google Form. Rich-text functionalities (such as bold/italics etc), though not supported natively by Google Form, would still work for Google Forms exported from Chú Ong Nâu.

Thanks [@nagthanm](https://github.com/nagthanm) for the hard work with the question library and quality control efforts.
